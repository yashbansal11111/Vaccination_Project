This is the "vaccination_drive" application based on Django created under "Vaccineproj" Django Project
I have created two models which are registering a User and providing his/her Vaccination details.
Views used here functions as, Homepage, Register the User, Login with Username & password, Add Vaccine Details only once logged in, Logout.
I have also used forms for registration pages so that I can register the user according to the fields required.
In addition I have used HTML rendering for displaying webpages on browser connected to my Views.
With Admin login you can see the list of Employee Details and Vaccination Details association with them.
